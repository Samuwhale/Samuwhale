I'm Samuel, a tech enthusiast with a strong passion for UX Design, Mixed Reality, and Gaming. My journey began with a Bachelor's in Information Science, and I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Human-Computer Interaction.

With a background in theater, I bring a unique perspective to creating engaging and user-friendly experiences. I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact on people's lives.

I'm always eager to collaborate on projects and apply my skills to innovate and create meaningful solutions. Let's connect and explore how we can work together.
